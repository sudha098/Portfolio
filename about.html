  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I’m a Cloud and DevOps professional with 6 years of experience, excluding 3 years in a government role. I specialize in building scalable cloud infrastructure, automating deployments, and implementing observability solutions using Kubernetes, GCP, AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. Troubleshooting complex issues and delivering reliable solutions is my forte.</p>
  <p>I’m punctual, sincere, and focused—I let my work speak for itself. Outside of work, I enjoy sipping tea, watching movies, catching up on sleep, and playing cricket. Though I’m more of an introvert, I’m always passionate about learning new technologies and solving challenging problems.</p>
